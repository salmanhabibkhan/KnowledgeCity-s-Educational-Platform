## ðŸš€ Key Technologies

- **Cloud**: AWS (Multi-region)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS)
- **IaC**: AWS CDK
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, CloudWatch, ELK Stack
- **Security**: WAF, KMS, Secrets Manager

## ðŸ“‹ Important Note

**This is purely an infrastructure and DevOps demonstration.** No actual applications (frontend/backend) have been developed as they are outside the scope of this assignment. The focus is on showcasing enterprise-level infrastructure design and DevOps best practices.

## Core Principles

### 1. Regional Data Isolation
- **US Users**: All personal data stored and processed in US East (us-east-1)
- **KSA Users**: All personal data stored and processed in Middle East (me-south-1)
- **Global Content**: Educational courses available worldwide via CDN

### 2. High Availability (99.99% SLA)
- Multi-Availability Zone deployment in each region
- Auto-failover capabilities
- Redundant infrastructure components
- Health monitoring and automatic recovery

### 3. Scalability
- Horizontal auto-scaling for all components
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
